+
+ *"In the Gap Junction, the space between universes, America Chavez and Defender Strange race to the Book of Vishanti while attempting to evade a Ribboned Creature. Strange's attempts to contain the monster prove futile, leading him to attempt to steal Chavez's power of multiversal travel, while knowing that the process would kill her. However, the demon kills Strange during the process, and Chavez, in fear, inadvertently opens a portal to Earth-616 which she and Strange's corpse fall through."
+ 
+ *"Doctor Strange wakes up, believing this vision to be a nightmare and continues about his day. He dresses up to attend Christine Palmer's wedding, there he reminisces about the time they previously spent together, but Palmer insists that the relationship would've failed regardless. During the celebration, an invisible entity begins to terrorize the streets of New York. Strange is forced to respond and reveals the entity as Gargantos, a gigantic tentacled monster. Also present is Chavez, whom Strange recognizes from his "nightmare" and rescues her. Wong arrives at the scene from Kamar-Taj, and together they kill Gargantos by gouging its eye out. Strange and Wong question Chavez, and she explains that the demons were hunting her for her powers. As proof of her claims, she takes them to the alternate Strange's corpse to prove that Strange's "nightmare" was actually a peek into his counterpart across the Multiverse."
+
+ *"Upon further inspection of the corpse, Strange discovers runes of witchcraft that he realises were also present on the tentacled creature. Knowing that this isn't his area of expertise, he visits Wanda Maximoff at her farm to ask her about what she knows about the Multiverse, but he soon discovers it be a chaos magic conjuration created by Maximoff herself. With the Darkhold in her possession and becoming the Scarlet Witch, Maximoff reveals herself as the one who sent the demons after Chavez, believing that she could reunite with Billy and Tommy once she is able to take over the Multiverse. She gives Strange before sundown to surrender Chavez at Kamar-Taj, otherwise she'll be coming as the "Scarlet Witch"."
+
+ *"With Chavez over at Kamar-Taj, the Masters of the Mystic Arts fortify the area in preparation for Maximoff's assault with a magic shield and various other defenses. However, Maximoff's telepathy targets one sorcerer and disables his magic, leading the shield to collapse, allowing her to shred through the resistance of Kamar-Taj. Strange entraps her within the Mirror Dimension, which proves to be ineffective as she escapes using reflections. Cornered, Chavez accidentally opens a portal, allowing herself and Strange to flee across the Multiverse. They land in Earth-838, in a futuristic New York City, where they walk towards the New York Sanctum in search of Strange's counterpart in this universe, but as that counterpart had died defeating Thanos previously, they are instead greeted by this universe's Sorcerer Supreme: Baron Mordo."
+
+ *"Despite their loss, Strange manages to inspire Chavez into refining her abilities against Maximoff, which results in her using her powers to send Maximoff back to Earth-838. There, she attacks her counterpart and attempts to comfort her kids, but they openly reject her. This causes Maximoff to collapse into tears, but her variant comforts her, breaking her out of the Darkhold's corruption. Realising the destruction she had caused, Maximoff sacrifices herself to destroy the castle and every copy of the Darkhold within the Multiverse as Wong and Chavez return to Kamar-Taj."
+
+ *"Before they both return to their home universes, Strange admits to Palmer that while he has always loved her, he was too insecure about committing to a real relationship, 838-Christine tells him to "Face his Fears", Kamar-Taj begins to rebuild as Chavez starts her training in the mystical arts, while Strange returns to New York and repairs the watch his Palmer gifted to him. He takes a walk afterwards, only to collapse and cry out in pain as his third eye opens."
+
+ "In a mid-credits scene: Strange is approached by a sorceress who warns him that his actions have triggered an incursion and they must put a stop to it. She opens a portal to the Dark Dimension and the two walk in."
